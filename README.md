Plan of attack:

## Server

- Setup Node/express server
- Integrate postgres db (elephantSql)
- Build routes
- Build queries at those routes
- Test to make sure data is getting returned properly

## Client

- create-react-app
- build simple ui to consume/interface with data

# INSTRUCTION TO RUN APPLICTION

- cd into /server
- run npm install
- run npm start
- server should boot up on port:8080

- cd into /client
- run npm install
- run npm start
- react app should boot up on port:3000

- Note: I've set up a proxy so everything should just work

### This was a fun exercise, cheers!
